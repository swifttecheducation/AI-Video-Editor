"""learned.py — the preferences the creator has TAUGHT this engine, as values a build can apply.

`brand-kit.md` Part C promises, in writing, that what she teaches is read before the next reel is built.
For a long time only the prose half existed: a bullet in a markdown file that a future session might or
might not open. Prose is not a mechanism. A tester was told her CapCut pass had been learned and saved —
true of the file, false of every build that followed.

So a preference is now written TWICE:
  * the bullet in brand-kit.md Part C, in her words — that half is hers to read.
  * a record here, in `_local/learned.json` — that half is what the builders actually apply.

`_local/` is protected by the updater and never ships, so what she teaches is hers and survives updates.

WHAT CAN BE LEARNED (and what deliberately cannot)
FIELDS below is an allowlist. A preference is only learnable when carrying it into the NEXT reel is safe:
sizes, spacing, density, which open zone to prefer, a named effect. Three things stay out on purpose:

  * REGISTER and ROUTE — asked fresh every reel, because they are decisions about THIS video.
  * HOOK COPY — measured, and never a mirror of the spoken line. A remembered hook is a wrong hook.
  * A PLACEMENT NUMBER — where she is on screen is MEASURED per reel (`subject_place`), never picked and
    never carried forward. A number learned on one reel lands on her forehead in the next. What IS
    learnable is which measured open zone to prefer (`hook.zone` = above/below/left/right); the number
    still comes from the measurement of THAT footage.

Everything is clamped to the bounds in FIELDS, so a bad record degrades one value instead of a reel.

API
  get(field, default, **ctx)   -> the learned value, else `default`; records that it was used
  value(field, default, **ctx) -> (value, record|None) when the caller wants the provenance
  add(field, value, ...)       -> validate + append (the `/learn` skill calls this)
  forget(ident)                -> drop one by id or by its number in `records()`
  records()                    -> every record, newest last
  report()                     -> the lines a build prints, so she can SEE what was applied
Stdlib only. Every entry point degrades to the shipped default rather than raising: a preferences file
must never be able to take a build down.
