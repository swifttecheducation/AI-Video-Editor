head-framing.py — where her head is in the frame, read off the footage instead of typed in by hand.

Two different moments ask that same question, so they share one detector (workflows/subject-zones.py and
product/chin_lock.py load it too):

  MEASURE       where her face and hair sit across the whole cut, and the 9:16 crop a source that is not
                1080x1920 needs first, centred on her face (pull-reels' cut-shorts.py reads that crop from
                head-framing.json to turn a wide recording into a vertical clip).
  ZOOM ANCHORS  --windows / --range: where her face sits inside EACH shot, so a push-in closes in on her
                rather than on the middle of the room.

Finding the head. Frames are pulled at even steps through the cut and OpenCV YuNet (its model ships in
assets/models/) boxes the face in each one. That box stops at the forehead, so the real top of the hair
takes a second look: the per-pixel median of every sampled frame is the empty room, because the wall stays
put and she does not, and the first row above her face that differs from it is where her hair starts. That
still works for dark hair against a dark wall, where an edge detector finds nothing. Each figure is a
median over the frames, which soaks up the drift from one take to the next.

  measure   uv run workflows/head-framing.py projects/<job>/outputs/<job>.mp4
            -> prints the face, the hair line and any 9:16 crop, saves projects/<job>/head-framing.json
  anchors   uv run workflows/head-framing.py <base-cut.mp4> --windows @projects/<job>/caption-plan.json \\
                --out projects/<job>/face-anchors.json
            uv run workflows/head-framing.py <base-cut.mp4> --range 4.3,6.1        (one window)
  --annotate OUT.PNG on measure also saves a frame with the measurement drawn onto it.
