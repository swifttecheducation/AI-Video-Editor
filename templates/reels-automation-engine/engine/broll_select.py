broll-select.py — pick the best usable moments from an EXISTING b-roll library, for a VO Reel.

The headline promise of the Voiceover Reel: the creator dumps the footage she already has (messy, long,
more than she needs) and the engine finds the good parts. She does not hand-curate or shoot to a shot list.
This is that engine — the same family as cover-frame.py (stills), extended to clips.

For every clip it slides a window across the whole thing and scores each window on what's actually
computable — no guessing:
  • sharpness   — Laplacian variance (rejects motion-blur / soft focus)
  • exposure    — mean luma near mid (rejects crushed-dark / blown-out)
  • stability   — frame-to-frame motion (rejects shaky / whip-pan sections)
  • FLICKER     — measured as OSCILLATION (rapid back-and-forth) of whole-frame mean AND horizontal-band
                  (row-std) brightness, at NATIVE fps. Oscillation is the discriminator: real flicker
                  (LED / fluorescent / dappled tree light) alternates frame to frame; motion and cuts are
                  smooth/single-step and do NOT oscillate, so they don't false-positive. Flicker is a HARD
                  REJECT — do NOT try to deflicker-rescue: ffmpeg deflicker only fixes the whole-frame
                  average and can leave (or worsen) LOCAL band flicker while the whole-frame check reads
                  "clean." Learned the hard way on a real clip (locked). If a window flickers, drop it.
                  Every window is checked over its WHOLE length, a hold as much as a burst.
  • energy      — motion magnitude, tagged calm/still vs active/busy, to match a window to a beat's mood.
It keeps the best FEW windows per clip (not one), at two lengths — short BURST windows (--win, default 2s)
for the opener and longer HOLD windows (--hold, default 4s) for the beats that sit on a shot — so a shot plan
can pair every moment of the voiceover with the best part of a clip, not just the single best 2 seconds of
it. Writes broll-select.json (one entry per clip, `windows` inside, the top-level fields = its best window
for backward compatibility) + a labeled contact sheet with one tile PER WINDOW.

What it does NOT do — and says so honestly: it does not understand CONTENT. Which shot suits which line
(baby vs laptop vs kitchen) is a human/Claude call — read the contact sheet, because catalog/clip labels
are per-clip and often wrong for a given timestamp (a "holding toddler" clip can be an outdoor path or a
screen-grab at another moment). Sample the window, look, then pair.

A dropped clip says WHY (too dark, too bright, too soft, or flicker), so it is clear whether --allow-flicker
would bring it back. iPhone Cinematic mode imports as a pair: IMG_1234.MOV is the raw capture (a flat
picture plus a depth track only Photos can read) and IMG_E1234.MOV the rendered one with the blur baked in.
When both are in the library the raw one is skipped and the E twin is scored; a raw one on its own is kept
and named, so its flat look is never a surprise.

Usage:
  uv run product/broll-select.py --lib ~/my-footage --job my-reel
  uv run product/broll-select.py --lib projects/<job>/broll --job <job> --need 8

  --lib DIR     folder of clips (default: projects/<job>/broll)
  --job NAME    writes projects/<job>/broll-select.json + broll-candidates.jpg
  --need N      cap on how many CLIPS to surface (default 0 = every usable clip; a prepped grabs folder is
                already curated, dropping its 9th-best clip loses a moment the plan may need)
  --win S       BURST window length in seconds (default 2.0)
  --hold S      HOLD window length in seconds (default 4.0; beats that sit on one shot)
  --per-clip K  best clean windows to keep per clip, per length (default 3)
  --json        also print the selection to stdout
  --allow-flicker  keep a clip whose only flaw is flicker. Use when the oscillation is an
                intentional look (sun glare, lens flare, dappled light), not a defect.
