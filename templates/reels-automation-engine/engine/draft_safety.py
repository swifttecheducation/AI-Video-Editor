"""draft_safety.py — LOCKED fail-safe for CapCut drafts: NEVER replace a draft with a rebuild.

The creator's hand-edits (fonts, effects, layout tweaks) live ONLY inside the CapCut draft, and CapCut
keeps NO version history and NO autosave. So a rebuild that deletes-and-recreates a draft destroys those
edits irreversibly. This module makes the safe path the only path.

Two allowed ways to apply a change to a draft the creator may have opened — NEVER a replace:
  1. LAYER on top       — add the new element additively to the existing draft (don't rebuild it).
  2. DUPLICATE + rebuild — copy to the next version name, build the change into the COPY.

New versions follow the sequence  <base> 1.1, <base> 1.2, <base> 1.3 ...  (never reuse a name).

Primitives:
  • next_version(base)              -> next unused '<base> N.M' name
  • refuse_replace(name)            -> HARD raise if a build would land on an existing draft
  • record_build(name)              -> snapshot a draft right after building (enables edit detection)
  • edited_in_capcut(name)          -> True if the draft changed since record_build (creator edited it)
  • list_versions(base)             -> the reel's version lineage, oldest -> newest
  • rolling_delete_candidates(base) -> oldest versions beyond KEEP_VERSIONS (ASK before deleting any)
  • recycle(name)                   -> REVERSIBLE removal to .recycle_bin (stashes the exact registry entry)
  • restore_draft(name)             -> reverse of recycle: folder + exact registry entry back (Bug #7/#7a)
  • duplicate_draft(name[,new])     -> copy to the next version + register the copy (DUPLICATE + rebuild path)

Never auto-delete. When rolling_delete_candidates is non-empty, ASK the creator whether to prune.
