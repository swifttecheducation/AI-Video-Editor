"""safe_zones.py — where the PLATFORM draws its own UI, so we never put anything there.

SHARED BASE MODULE. Every engine that places an element on a 1080x1920 reel imports these numbers rather
than hardcoding its own. One correction lands everywhere.

## Why this exists

The engine once documented "top 200px / bottom 300px". The TOP was too generous: Meta's own Reels
guidance reserves the **top 14%** of the frame, and a persistent label placed at y201-263 shipped sitting
directly under Instagram's Reels header. It looked fine in the render and fine in QuickTime. You only see
it in the app, on the phone, after posting.

That is the trap: a UI collision is invisible everywhere except the one place that matters.

The BOTTOM has a different history: it went to 480 (TikTok's band) for a while, then back to 300 by the
creator's explicit decision (locked) — see BOTTOM below. That is a deliberate trade of platform caution
for usable frame, backed by the pipeline's Export step (open the posted reel in the app and look).

## The numbers (1080 x 1920)

                     top reserved   bottom reserved   notes
  Instagram Reels    269 (14%)      384 (20%)         Meta's published guidance
  TikTok             ~260           ~480              heavier bottom + a right-hand action rail
  YouTube Shorts     ~180           ~380              lighter top

`TOP` is the STRICTEST across the three (the incident band). `BOTTOM` is the creator's explicit call:
300px clear, LOOSER than every platform's published band. The per-platform table stays factual, so
`violations(elements, platform="reels")` still reports against Instagram's real band when that matters.

# ---- LEGIBILITY FLOORS ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Minimum rendered size per role, in px on the 1080x1920 canvas. A reel is watched on a phone: 1080px maps
# to roughly 390pt, so 1px is about 0.36pt. A 44px caption reads as ~16pt, which is fine. 30px reads as
# ~11pt, which is not.
#
# Why these exist: sizes are COMPUTED (fitted to a band, scaled off an anchor, shrunk to fit a width), and
# a computed size can collapse without anything erroring. Measured case: captions rendered at 43px instead
# of the pack's own 61px because they were anchored to a hook that had shrunk. It looked deliberate. The
# engine's own floors were `max(20, ...)`, which is far below anything readable, so nothing caught it.

    "subhead":  28,   # eyebrow above/below the headline
    "takeover": 60,   # full-screen word stack
