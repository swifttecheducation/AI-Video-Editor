"""subject_guard.py — prove a graphics layer never lands on HER. Deterministic, no eyeballing.

The subject-relative sibling of the safe-zone check in reel_render.py. That one asks "is this ink inside
the platform's UI band"; this asks "is this ink on her face", and nothing in the engine could answer it
before, because the two live in different files: the overlay renders TRANSPARENT and the footage is not in
the composition, so `hyperframes check` measures a canvas with no person in it and passes text sitting
squarely on a forehead. Every existing check is blind to this by construction. That is why the defect
shipped repeatedly and why "remember not to cover my face" could never hold: nothing was looking.

Method is caption_guard's, pointed at a measured subject box instead of a fixed caption band: alpha-extract
the layer, crop to the box `workflows/subject-zones.py` measured on the real footage, binarize, and read the
covered fraction frame by frame. Spot-checking frames cannot catch this — a hook can clear her head at the
start of its hold and sit on her hair by the end of it, so the whole hold has to be swept.

Exit 1 on a collision (with --strict, which reel_render passes). A transparent layer that covers nothing is
reported as such and never silently called clean.
